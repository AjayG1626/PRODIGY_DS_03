# Building a Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
This project demonstrates how to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we aim to illustrate the steps involved in preprocessing the data, training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions. This classifier can help businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively by identifying potential customers who are more likely to make a purchase.

# Key Points:
# Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset and explore its structure.
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Model Building:
Use the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn to train the model.
Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.
Visualize the decision tree to understand the model's decision-making process.
# Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict whether new customers will purchase the product or service.
